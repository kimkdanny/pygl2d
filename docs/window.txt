pygl2d.window

PyGL2D's window module is for setting up the window for drawing.


 window.init(size, caption="", flags=DOUBLEBUF)

  --  Initialise the SDL/PyGame window.

 window.begin_draw()
 
  -- Call this right before you begin drawing your
  -- objects.
  
 window.end_draw()
 
  -- And always call this after you're done drawing.

pygl2d.rect

PyGL2D's rect module provides a class similar to pygame's rect. It supports
floating point numbers, but it misses alot of pygame's rect functions.

class rect.Rect(object)

  __init__(self, x, y, w, h)
  
  -- init the Rect. x and y should be its topleft position, and w and h
  -- should be its width and height.
  
  move(dx, dy) <- return Rect
  
  -- Create a new rect moved the amount of dx and dy.
  
  move_ip(dx, dy)
  
  -- Move the rect the amount of dx and dy.
  
  colliderect(rect)
  
  -- Check for a collision between another rect.
  
  collidepoint(point)
  
  -- Check for a collision between the rect and a point.

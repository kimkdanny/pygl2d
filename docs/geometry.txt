pygl2d.geometry

PyGL2D's geometry module lets you execute some simple geometry functions, such
as circle collisions and line collisions. It has some other functions, but
they're not working correctly right now. Sorry!

geometry.line_collision(a, b) <- return bool

  -- Detects a collision between line a, and line b.

geometry.poly_collision(poly1, poly2) <- return bool

  -- Detects a collision between two polys.

geometry.circle_collision(p1, p2, r1, r2) <- return bool

  -- Detects a collision between 2 circles. p1 and r1 should be the
  -- position and radius of the first circle, respectively.
  -- p2 and r2 should be the position and radius of the second circle, 
  -- respectively.

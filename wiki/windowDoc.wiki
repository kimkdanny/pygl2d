= pygl2d.window =

PyGL2D's window module is for setting up the window for drawing.

=== window.init(size, caption="PyGL2D Window", flags=DOUBLEBUF) ===

Initialise the SDL/PyGame window. `caption` is the window caption. `flags` can be extra flags.

=== window.begin_draw() ===
 
Call this right before you begin drawing your objects. If you don't, then you won't see anything!

=== window.end_draw() ===
 
And always call this after you're done drawing, or else you'll get some crazy GL errors.
